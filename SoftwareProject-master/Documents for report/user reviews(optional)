What we should have after reviewing the competitors customer reviews

Tangible augmented reality - for designing three dimensional AR + it supports seamless interaction between the real and virtual worlds, also provides a range of natural interactions that are hard to find in typical AR interfaces.
Tracking markers - to define the scale and coordinates
ARToolKit can be used to calculate 3D positions and orientations of the virtual furniture
The AR application should determine the viewpoint of the user in the real world.
This would be done relative to the physical markers
Our main principles should be colour, scale and proportion in a determined space.
