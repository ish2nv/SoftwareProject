Dear Sir/Madam

We are a group of Computer Science students studying at Goldsmiths Univesity of London, in search
for a company that will be able to give us some feedback on our software project.

InteriAR is an innovative way of providing home owners inspiration on the go.
Our application will use tools and information to help users envision their dream home
using advanced augmented reality technology. Users will be able to drag and drop 3d images
of furniture, and place it to create a visual image of their living space.
Choosing wall paint can be a stressful task that requires a great amount of detailing, however our app will allow users to
choose from a wide selection of colours and test them virtually on their walls. This not only will
save time, but also avoid potential costly mistakes during renovation.

Once the user is satisfied with a design, they will be matched with local decorating companies to make their vision a reality,
~~with clear visual images to show what they'd like~~.    _re-word stricken through bit probably?_

What we'd really appreciate from you is to hear any feedback on the concept - and potentially whether your company would be interested
in learning more about the app once it's developed or _and?_ even possibly becoming one of our trusted decorators.
_whole last bit is messy, run on sentence - reword_
